# v1.1
- JWT implemented in the backend and frontend. Basic auth is still available for endpoints, but is to be avoided if possible.
- Drag and drop functionality added to the frontend. This functionality works in the list, grid and uploda views, and checks the mime type before upload as well.
- Delete button in detail view of the frontend. The grid view shows nicer preview images but lacked a way to delete images. This is now possible via the delete button in the detail view.
- better preview handling and clearer status return flag for entry upload
